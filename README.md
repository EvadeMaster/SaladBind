# SaladBind

## About

**This application is not affiliated with Salad Technologies.** It is made by Vukky Limited, for the entire Salad community.

*BIND-ing* the good features from other projects together! (and fucking nuke the bad ones)

It's like if CLI and CLI+ had a baby: Switch between miners and pools with ease, a fancy UI, and some brand-new extras, like an interactive configuration editor built right in to the program; no website involved!

And the best part: It's open source! And another best part (heh) is that we don't ever use your token, except for *once* in the configuration process - you can get your Rig ID automatically using your token! But once you've done that, **never again** - we don't even store it! But honestly, you don't even have to give your token, you can enter your Rig ID manually too! Security first!

Oh, and did we mention the insane data savings? SaladBind downloads miners on demand, so there's no need to download 460MB of miners you'll never use, AND you don't have to install Python, Java, or whatever on your computer. Just download SaladBind, and you're good to go - it's only 40-50MB!

Oh and one last thing, did we mention it's not-for-profit? We don't have hidden fees and pools which means we do not scrape on top of your earnings.

Welcome to the next generation of Salad CLIs!

## Installation

### Configuration

Once you start it for the first time, it'll prompt you to enter your mining details.
