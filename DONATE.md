# Donate to the SaladBind developers

Although SaladBind does not require funding to operate, you can send the developers money to show your support.

We greatly appreciate anything you send, although you don't have to do this! The only reason this page exists is because people have asked for it - SaladBind is still not a for-profit application, and it never will be. More donation options coming soon.
