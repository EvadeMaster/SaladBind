# SaladBind

## About

**This application is not affiliated with Salad Technologies.** It is made by Vukky Limited, for the entire Salad community.

BIND-ing the good features from other projects together! (and fucking nuking the bad ones)

It's like if CLI and CLI+ had a baby: Switch between miners and pools with ease, there's a fancy UI, plus some brand new extras, like an interactive configuration editor - right in the program, no website involved!

And the best part: It's open source! And another best part (heh) is that we don't ever use your token, except for *once* in the configuration system - you can get your Rig ID automatically using your token! But once you've done that, **never again** - we don't even store it! To be honest, you don't even have to do it, you can enter your Rig ID manually too! Security first!

Oh, and did we mention the insane data savings? SaladBind downloads miners on demand, so there's no need to download 460MB of miners you'll never use, AND you don't have to install Python, Java, or whatever on your computer. Just download SaladBind, and you're good to go - it's only 40-50MB!

Oh, *and* did we mention it's not for-profit? We don't have hidden fees and pools.

Welcome to the next generation of Salad CLIs!
